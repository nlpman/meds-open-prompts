# Setup
## Virtual Environment and Package Manager
This project uses pyenv ( https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv ) for virtual environments and poetry ( https://python-poetry.org/ ) for package management.

There are many other ways to set up a virtual environment. Here are instructions for using pyenv:
```
pyenv versions   # see what's already installed -- is 3.10.x there?
pyenv install 3.10.5  # install it if it's not (otherwise skip this step)
pyenv local 3.10.5   # set this version for your local environment
```
After that, you can set use poetry to install dependencies into this virtual environment:
```
poetry install
```
